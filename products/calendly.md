## Reclaim Your Time with Automated Scheduling

If you've ever experienced the frustration of exchanging multiple emails just to schedule a single meeting, you understand the time drain and inefficiency of manual scheduling. Calendly eliminates this problem entirely, giving you a professional scheduling system that works 24/7 while protecting your calendar and productivity.

## What is Calendly?

Calendly is a scheduling automation platform that allows people to book time on your calendar based on your real-time availability. It eliminates scheduling back-and-forth by showing your invitees only the times you're actually available, preventing double-booking, and integrating seamlessly with your existing calendar and meeting tools.

## Who Calendly is Perfect For

- **Consultants and coaches** scheduling client sessions
- **Sales professionals** booking demos and prospect calls
- **Recruiters** organizing candidate interviews
- **Customer success teams** managing onboarding and support calls
- **Team leaders** scheduling 1:1 meetings efficiently
- **Anyone** who schedules meetings regularly and values their time

## How Calendly Transforms Your Scheduling Process

### Eliminate Email Back-and-Forth Completely

Share your Calendly link via email, embed it on your website, or include it in your email signature. Your invitees see only times when you're available, select their preferred slot, and the meeting is automatically added to everyone's calendars—no further action required from you.

### Project Professionalism to Clients and Prospects

The Calendly booking experience is clean, intuitive, and branded to your business. Invitees receive professional confirmations and reminders, creating a seamless experience that reflects positively on your business from the first interaction.

### Protect Your Productivity with Smart Scheduling Rules

Set buffer times between meetings, minimum scheduling notice, daily meeting limits, and time blocks when you're unavailable for meetings. These guardrails ensure you maintain productive work time while still offering flexible scheduling options.

### Connect Your Entire Meeting Workflow

Calendly integrates with video conferencing tools (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet), payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), CRMs, and more to create an end-to-end meeting workflow. Automatically generate conference links, collect payments for paid sessions, or gather information from invitees before meetings.

### Scale Your Scheduling Across Teams

For teams, Calendly offers round-robin distribution, collective scheduling pages, and team-wide availability management. This makes it easy to distribute meetings fairly among team members or find the first available slot across multiple team members' calendars.

## Standout Features That Make a Difference

### Automatic Time Zone Detection

Calendly detects your invitees' time zones and displays available times in their local time, eliminating confusion and missed meetings due to time zone miscalculations.

### Customizable Scheduling Links

Create different event types for various meeting purposes—each with its own duration, availability windows, and custom questions. For example, have separate links for "30-minute introductory call," "60-minute consultation," and "15-minute check-in."

### Booking Page Customization

Brand your scheduling page with your logo, colors, and custom text to create a cohesive experience that aligns with your business identity.

### Calendar Connection

Connect multiple calendars (personal and work) to prevent double-booking across your entire schedule, even for personal appointments that others don't need to see details of.

### Automated Workflows

Create workflows that trigger actions before or after meetings—like sending customized confirmation emails, follow-up messages, or thank you notes.

### Routing Forms

Guide invitees to the right type of meeting or team member with qualification questions that route to different scheduling options based on responses.
